# DSP
Digital Signal Processing project work

# Goal
The goal of this project is to extract two audio information signals from the modulated signal *signal_028.wav*, of the form:

𝑦(𝑛𝑇) = (𝑥<sub>1</sub>(𝑛𝑇) + 𝐴<sub>1</sub>) cos(2𝜋𝑓<sub>1</sub>𝑛𝑇) + (𝑥<sub>2</sub>(𝑛𝑇) + 𝐴<sub>2</sub>)cos⁡(2𝜋𝑓<sub>2</sub>𝑛𝑇)

and using some known characteristics of the signal, such as:
- Sampling Frequency: Fs = 96000 Hz
- Useful Frequency Band: [20 8000] Hz
- Carriers at Frequencies 𝑓<sub>1</sub> and 𝑓<sub>2</sub>, with 10000 Hz ≤ 𝑓<sub>1</sub> ≤ 𝑓<sub>2</sub> ≤ 38000 Hz and 𝑓<sub>2</sub> - 𝑓<sub>1</sub> ≥ 17000 Hz, with
amplitude 𝐴<sub>1</sub> and 𝐴<sub>2</sub>
- Duration of the signal: 42 s

# Output
The obtained output file is a cropped piece from "Father and Son" by Cat Stevens.
